# Justin Hedrick

Senior Full Stack Developer with a strong focus on building reliable, secure, and maintainable web applications.  
I specialize in modern Angular and TypeScript front ends paired with PHP based RESTful APIs, and I have extensive experience modernizing legacy systems without unnecessary rewrites.

Most of my professional work lives in private repositories, but this profile showcases personal projects, experiments, and examples of how I approach architecture, code quality, and problem solving.
